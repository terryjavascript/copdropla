# WHAT TEETRAVELSWORLD?

[teetravelsworld](http://www.teetravelsworld.com) is my web application. Started in 2016 during my study abroad to Spain, I started blogging multiple travel posts on my experiences of 52 cities (and counting!) and tips for future travelers. The adventures were originally posted on my tumblr page (http://teetravelsworld.tumblr.com/) & my personal instagram (https://www.instagram.com/teetravelsworld/). Later, before starting to learn coding, I hosted my own domain via squarespace (https://www.squarespace.com/). My travel posts contained topics about hot food spots, culture of the city, transporation advices, travel-product reviews, motivations and persuasions to travel, financial tips, and much more. My goal and motive is to help people plan safe and efficient travel (time, money, comfort).

# SUMMARY

On this application project, I've decided to combine functions of what seems personally important from my experience to have before planning to travel. I've created a portal for all the applications and websites I use to travel. I've also added a slide show of sites I've previously visited and a music playlist I listen to whenever I travel abroad. Google map (with manual pointers - left click) and weather display is also available by inputting city zipcode. The main support of this application is the live chatbox. Users are able to communicate with other travelers as well as myself.  

# Applied Functions 

Two APIs were added for this application: Google Map API & Open Weather Map API. Firebase and node.js were added for live chatbox to maintain realtime application requests and responses, and to store texts in global database. Both Javascript (map.js, slideshow.js) and JQuery (weather.js, chatbox.js) were used to show my capability to understand and apply both scripts. Bootstrap was used to design and control the divs in my application better. Lastly, music player was added from a 3rd party developer (http://kolber.github.io/audiojs/) and then was formatted to scale to my application.

# OBSTACLES

The main obstable for this project was creating the chatbox and the weather display. It was hard to design and put together the pieces of each shape from CSS to create the right image. It took hundreds of tries, and by having too much shapes, each size change created an error of the whole design. Calling APIs of the weather was also very challenging as I wanted to call the API with city name as zipcode did not cover international states. Overall, I've built and applied what I felt useful in my initial sketch. 

# Future Developments:

I wish to add Google distance calculator as well as Google Map locator in my future development towards this map. As of now, the zipcode text input bar is only connected to the weather API. I wish to connect that with also the googlemap API. I also wish to connect my social media posts from both tumblr and instagram to automatically display my recent posts for other users to see.
